## What you will find here
I'm not a full time programmer. I'm interessed in analising data to better understand the world. Here you will find some small projects I've worked  (some serious and others just for fun).

## What I'm trying to achieve
I am learning Python to improve my data and business analysis. I really like business innovations and new tech products. In general, my analysis are about things I'm just curious about
